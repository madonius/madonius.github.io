Human living in Karlsruhe doing stuff with computers.
I am firm with [Python](https://python.org), did some [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)
in the past and know how to hack stuff in \*sh.

Aside from that, I sometimes solder stuff and am surprised that they actually work.

Contrary to most humanoids I dislike [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee)
and love [Yerba Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate)
