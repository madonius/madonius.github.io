Welcome! So you have decided to visit Crete, excellent choice if I say so myself!
Depending on what you want to do the island has multiple things to offer, as you
will find out with the following.

## Food!

### What to eat

As most of the Balkans, Greece's puff pastry game is very strong.
You can get puff pastry with:
- Spinach (Spanakopita)
- Cheese (Tiropita)
- Spinach and cheese (Spanakotiropita)
- Leeks (Prasopita)
etc.

If you like the filling you most likely will love the pie too

Coffee. People consume that beverage like it's their job.
Mornings, noons, evenings, nights even ✅✅✅

There's the **"greek coffee"** (very similar to a mokka), **fredo**, cappuchino, etc.

#### Frapé

Most notably though there's frapé. It's a staple drink in the summer and it's
characteristically slow consumption is considered by some an art form.

When you order it keep in mind there are two parameters that you're expected to choose
sugar content and milk content.
Each of those can be set to one of three values, four if you count the absence of the ingredient.
- (No)
- Low
- Medium
- A lot

I can only encourage you to try it and experiment.

### Where to eat

#### Heraklion

##### Breakfast
- **[Kritikos Fournos](https://kritikosfournosdaily.gr/en/our-points/)** offers a wide selection of "breakfast items".
  They are a chain and have multiple locations, it's hard to miss really
  and they also have a wide selection of beverages, sandwiches and the sorts.

- **[Phyllosofies](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6W1vFJRBDeb1c7vN7)** the reason you go there is to eat [boughatsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bougatsa).
  That's it, if you don't try this, then I'd have to ask you why you visited the city in the first place.

##### Gyros (Suvlaki etc.)
- **[Veganato](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6nZoN1dWJwALfRPR8)** Vegan gyros that tastes good
- **[Afthentiko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k8eHiuEsKTE5kCa49)** 

##### Dinner
- **[Ippokampos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imCR2hfvXNCo6JxL6)** Excellent traditional and a great selection of sea food.
