Human living in Europe doing stuff with humans and computers.

Chief Technical Officer of [Famedly](https://famedly.com) <br>
and chair of [Entropia e.V.](https://entropia.de). <br>
Appreciator of the occasional shitpost.

Feels at home with:
* Ansible
* Python
* Linux
* various shells

Aside from that, I sometimes solder stuff and am surprised when they actually work.

### Fun fact about me
Contrary to most humanoids I dislike [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee)
and love [Yerba Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate)
